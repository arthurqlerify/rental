Feature: Schedule Inspection
  As a Property Manager
  I want to schedule an inspection for a turnover
  So that I can ensure the apartment is ready for re-leasing

  Scenario: Given an active turnover and available inspection slots before or at move-out, When the PropertyMgr schedules the inspection with a date, time and inspector, Then Inspection Scheduled is recorded with the appointment details.
